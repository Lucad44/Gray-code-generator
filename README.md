# Gray-code-generator
This program, entirely written in python 3, can construct an n-bits Gray code, all formatted in nice and tidy table. 
You can choose whether to output the table directly in the console or a text file (strongly recommended for larger numbers of bits).
The output in the .txt file will be plain text, unlike in the console. 
Enter a too big number of bits at your own risk.

It can convert a single decimal number to Gray code as well.
Console application only for now.
